### Building…

Working on open source projects old and new like [SAPIENTA](https://sapienta.dcs.aber.ac.uk/) and [Gastronaut](https://brainsteam.co.uk/2023/11/13/gastronaut-fediverse-recipe-app/) and building plugins and utilities. I’m a big fan of tinkering with open source stuff. I try to be responsive but I also kind of subscribe to [SOFA](https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/) when it comes to personal projects.

### Enjoying…

Reading lots of fiction and sci-fi, you can [find me on Bookwyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/@jamesravey) where I keep track of my progress.

Playing video games on my [[steamdeck]] – currently enjoying [[Cyberpunk 2077]] with the Phantom Liberty DLC.

Listening to a hugely eclectic variety of [music](https://brainsteam.co.uk/music/).

Drinking plenty of coffee

### Working…

I have been the CTO at Filament.ai since 2016.
