Checklist is a behavioural testing approach for language models developed by Marco Tulio Ribeiro [^ribeiroAccuracyBehavioralTesting2020]

Checklist is inspired by unit testing in software engineering. Minimum Functionality Tests (MFTs) are created which consist of examples and associated labels that can be used to test specific model behaviours.
