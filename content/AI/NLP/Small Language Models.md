- Small Language Models encapsulates the subset of neural language models that are small enough to be used and even fine-tuned on a single computer. Notable examples are [[models/ai.nlp.transformers.bert]] and its variants as well as modestly-sized auto-regressive generative models such as [[ai.nlp.transformers.bart]] and [[ai.nlp.transformers.t5]].
