## Coverage
### 2023-02
- In Feb 2023, Charlie Stross wrote about the suspicious timing of the release of ChatGPT and other recent AI breakthroughs (e.g. [[stable-diffusion|Stable Diffusion]]) given the crypto winter. His article [^1] is written in his relatively typical ranty way but it does contain some interesting nuggets:
- He specifically denigrates the massive influx of AI "news" coverage from late 2022 and early 2023, asking "who is paying people to write this stuff?"
- He predicts an AI bubble will burst once people realise that [[llms]] models with limited/no curation are unreliable.
- He compares the current AI bubble with the crypto bubble.
- Whether the use case is crypto or AI, GPU vendors are laughing all the way to the bank.
