- Large Language models is a label that is typically applied to very large neural transformer-based language models such as the [[models/ai.nlp.transformers.gpt]] family of models and others including [[models/ai.nlp.transformers.bloom]].
  
  Until recently, LLMs were generally too big to run on a single machine (as opposed to [[slm]]).
- ## Veracity of Generated Outputs
  
  LLMs like [[ChatGPT]] have seen mainstream success because they are able to generate convincing-sounding answers to most questions. Despite recent work finding that they are often plain wrong [^1], they may still appeal to professionals due to the "articulate nature" of the outputs they are able to generate [^2]
