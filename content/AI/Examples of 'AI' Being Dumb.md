> So much AI turns out to be low-waged people in a call center in the Global South pretending to be robots that Indian techies have a joke about it: “AI stands for ‘absent Indian’” - [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/31/neural-interface-beta-tester/)

- **04/02/24** - via [Yoav Goldberg](https://twitter.com/yoavgo/status/1753556086534070706) - [GEM using models to predict protected characteristics of job applicants](https://archive.jamesravey.me/archive/1707030622.46187/index.html) when such information is not supplied
- **28/01/24** [Dudesy Podcast claimed that they trained an AI to impersonate the late comedian George Carlin](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/) but [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/29/pay-no-attention/#to-the-little-man-behind-the-curtain) and [Simon Willison](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/willison_ai_software_development/) both call bullshit. IT stinks of the "We made an AI watch 100 hours of X..." meme that went round a few years ago.

- **20/12/23** [Chevrolet integrated a ChatGPT-powered bot into their site](https://gizmodo.com/ai-chevy-dealership-chatgpt-bot-customer-service-fail-1851111825) but because there is no such thing as input sanitization for LLMs, people used [[prompt injection]] attacks to make the bot agree to sell users cars for $1.
