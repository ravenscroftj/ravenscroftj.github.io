The Hu are a mongolian folk metal band who combine elements of mongolian throat singing with modern metal.

I've come across them a number of times but most recently as part of the [[Star Wars Jedi - Fallen Order (2019)]] game where they provide an "alien" track which the main character likes to listen to whilst working.
