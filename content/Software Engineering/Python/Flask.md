Flask is a lightweight and robust [[python]] web framework with a minimal approach (as opposed to the batteries-included approach taken by [[django]]).

## Template

I have a template flask app with barebones db and config stuff set up here: https://git.jamesravey.me/ravenscroftj/flask-template

The template includes:
 - [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/quickstart/)
 - [Flask-Alembic](https://flask-alembic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 -
