[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro) is a [[semantic-search]] engine that allows rapid prototyping of search pipelines that leverage [[Transformers]] to encode queries.

Haystack supports using [[faiss]] as an indexing system as well as other search systems such as [[elasticsearch]].
