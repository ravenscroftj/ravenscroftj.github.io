Notion is a SaaS [[pkm]] platform. It is a siloed solution where your data is stored in the cloud so it may not be ideal for personal knowledge vaults. However, the team experience is quite slick.

Notion is [SOC2 compliant](https://www.notion.so/blog/notion-soc-2-compliant). Motion's always online architecture makes it inappropriate for local-first note taking use cases where Internet access may be unstable.
