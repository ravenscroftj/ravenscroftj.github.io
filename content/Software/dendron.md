Dendron is a [[Public/PKM/index|index]] system and an example of [[pkm.tools-for-thought]] with similar properties to systems like Roam, Obsidian and Logseq. It runs inside VSCode and supports building a hierarchical collection of interlinked notes along with fancy visualisations of how the notes relate to each other.

On the 7th of February 2023, the founder of Dendron announced that the product would no longer be maintained by the dendron company. An open source community may take over development and maintainence of the system.
