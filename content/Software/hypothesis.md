[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) is an online annotation platform that allows users to annotate any webpage or document that they encounter and easily share their annotations with each other.

I use hypothesis for making notes on web pages and have written plugins for [[vscode]] and [[joplin]] that allow users to sync their hypothesis notes with those products.
