# Gitea

Gitea is a lightweight version control hub that provides git hosting, project management, release management and packages. It's very powerful and very efficient (written in Go and uses minimal memory).

## Actions

Gitea have recently introduced a CI actions feature which is compatible with github's actions. I am compiling notes on this under #GiteaActions
