Jupyter is an interactive [[python]] interpreter with a web component that can run in-browser to make scripting and experimentation easier for non-engineers. This can sometimes have adverse effects on the quality of the code produced. Jupyter Notebooks can often become long and convoluted and full of spaghetti code.

## Google Colab

Colab is a heavily customised Jupyter environment made available by google to users who wish to experiment with [[ml|Machine Learning]] and [[python]].
