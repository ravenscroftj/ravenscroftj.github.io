Wireless Earbuds from Anker.

## What to do when the devices stop talking to each other

Forget them on your device. Then reset them in the case (put in case, press both buttons for 3 or whatever seconds until 3 red blinks). After resetting them in the charging box you then need to remove both units and watch the LEDs on them. The LEDs light up white and the two buds chat to each other for about fives seconds as they marry up. Then one of them goes dark and the other one starts flashing quickly in pairing mode. Only then you pair to them to your phone. Pair with the one that says P2 (Not the P2-L one). You should get a pair confirmation on your phone too (you won’t get that if it’s still screwed up).
