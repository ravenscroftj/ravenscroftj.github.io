- GTD or Getting things done is a workflow proposed by [David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
- It has 5 key steps which are outlined by [todoist here](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done):
### Capture
- write down everything, no matter how big or small. This will allow you to clear your mind and get the thing out of your short term/working memory and also preserve it for posterity.
- [in his podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/40O0Lbp5ockSt0qSogo6q1) Tiago Forte suggests that people may not do this if they do not have respect for their own ideas “this has already been done” or “this will never work” and that 
  >  > "Writing down your ideas is an act of radical self trust in your own ideas. "
### Clarify
- Take steps to understand what the things are that you've captured and why they're important.
- What is the thing? What is needed? Is it rubbish? Does it make sense? How important is it?
- Is the thing actionable? Can it be made actionable? What is the first thing that needs to be done?
- If **no**🚫 then it is:
	- **rubbish** 🗑️ - it can be chucked out
	- **reference material** 📚 - it needs to be stored away somewhere appropriate
	- **something that needs doing later** ⏰ - needs to be incubated, set a reminder.
- If **yes** ✅ then:
	- if it will take less than 2 mins to deal with, just do it
	- if someone else can do it then **delegate**
	- otherwise it will need to be stored away somewhere appropriate.
	- [David Allen reckons](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2017/02/episode-27-gtd-keys-to-clarifying/) most professionals have around 150-200 atomic tasks on their todo list and around 30-40 “projects” where more than one step needs to be taken to close out a commitment.
