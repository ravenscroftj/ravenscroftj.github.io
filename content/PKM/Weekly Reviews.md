A weekly review provides an opportunity to celebrate your wins, commiserate your losses and plan your next move. Almost all PKM authors advocate weekly reviews of some description.

### What Should I Review?

During a weekly review you should revisit the past week and consider things that went well and the things that didn't Anne-Laure at Ness Labs advocates a simple 3 column table called [Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) ([mirror](https://archive.jamesravey.me/archive/1705870144.619148/index.html)). You write what went well under the '+' column, what went poorly under '-' and what you will do next under '-&gt;'.

#### Ta-da List

A [ta-da list](https://habitgrowth.com/tada-list/) is what happens when you complete things off your todo list - it's stuff you've finished. Having sight of all the stuff you checked off this week can be quite inspiring and help you to fight off any negative self-talk along the lines of "I'm useless" or "I never achieve anything".

I like to use Logseq to show me any tasks that I have done within a week which I've tagged with #Goals - that way I can quickly see a list of things that I've achieved.

```
- {{query((and [[Goals]] (task DONE) (between [[Jan 14th,2024]] [[Jan 21st,2024]])))}}
  query-table:: true
```
