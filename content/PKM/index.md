Personal Knowledge Management or PKM is a set of practices and tools that help people to manage their personal knowledge (it's quite tautologous). 

Many people keep a [[Second Brain]] which helps them to organise their thoughts into notes. Some people prefer to [[Learning in Public|learn in public]] and keep a public second brain or [[Digital Gardens|digital garden]] that others can explore. 

There are lots of processes and strategies that can make PKM effective such as having regular [[Weekly Reviews|weekly]], [[Monthly Reviews|monthly]] and [[Annual Reviews|annual]] reviews.
