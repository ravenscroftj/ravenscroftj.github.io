Cognitive constructivism is the idea that learning is an incremental process involving reflection and active construction within the mind [^brauConstructivism2020]. Learners build new knowledge actively based on new information and historical experiences in their own mind [^mcleodConstructivismTheoryTeaching2019].

 It was popularised by Jean Piaget.
