Enshittification is the a term coined by [Greg Gant](https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2018/12/27/welcome-to-the-enshittening.html) and then taken and carried by [[cory-doctorow]]. It describes the gradual decline in quality of products and services over time caused by easing of market effects on monopolies.

Great examples of enshittification in the wild are [Amazon](https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola), [TikTok](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/) and twitter.

## Enshittification of Knowledge

As surmised by [Daragh O Brien](https://castlebridge.ie/insights/llms-and-the-enshittening-of-knowledge/), recent developments in [[Language Model]], and the general availability of [[ChatGPT]] and competing models, may well have enabled the enshittification of what we know.
