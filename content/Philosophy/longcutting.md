- # Longcutting
  
  The opposite of taking the short cut is taking a long cut [^1] or doing things the hard way. Sometimes this is unintentional, when a shortcut backfires but. Sometimes a longcut can be deliberate. Particularly in cases where the quality of an output is very important. 
  
  Building a [[pkm.zettelkasten]] or [[Second Brain]] could be considered an example of this as it requires more work and maintainence but the returns you get are richer and more valuable on a personal level.
