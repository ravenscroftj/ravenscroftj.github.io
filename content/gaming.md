## Gaming on Linux

I typically just use Steam for managing games on Linux. However, for games I've bought through other storefronts I use [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/) for wine environments.

### ProtonUp

Use [ProtonUp](https://github.com/AUNaseef/protonup) to install custom versions of proton on the deck. You can find this in the Software store on the deck's KDE desktop (open up Discover on steamOS and search `protonup-qt`)

### Heroic Launcher

Heroic is a GUI that wraps both Epic and GOG allowing installation of games from both stores. Install Heroic through discover. Heroic can be added as a non-steam game so that it can be used to launch games from other stores in entertainment mode.

### Rockstar Launcher

### GOG Galaxy

Bottles has a GOG Galaxy installer, it works relatively well (rated 'silver' as of writing) but occasionally comes up with a prompt telling you that a background service has crashed.
