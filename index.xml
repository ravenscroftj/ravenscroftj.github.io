      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;m James, I&amp;rsquo;m an AI Geek with lots of interests and lots of jobs. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the software industry professionally for 8 years (10 if you count the time I spent freelancing at University). I spent a lot of time working for IBM, originally in transaction processing and enterprise application servers. Then I moved to IBM Watson Ecosystem where I was the main solutions architect serving Europe, Middle East and Africa for around 12 months.</description>
