      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on quite a few open and closed source projects - feel free to take a look at my github profile.
Below are a selection of open source projects that I am most proud of or have been the primary contributer on. I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much time as I&amp;rsquo;d like to maintain these projects but I do when I get chance. Feel free to contact me on twitter if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in helping out with any of the below projects.</description>

      <description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the software industry professionally for 10 years. I spent a lot of time working for IBM, originally in transaction processing and enterprise application servers. Then I moved to IBM Watson Ecosystem where I was the main solutions architect serving Europe, Middle East and Africa for around 12 months. I&amp;rsquo;m now the CTO at Filament and a part time PHD student. My exposure to both academia and practical software engineering has given me a unique perspective onto how cutting edge AI and ML techniques could be commercialised and applied to real problems.</description>
